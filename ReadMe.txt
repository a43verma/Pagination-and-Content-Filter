Pagination and Content Filter:

I built this project for the completion of Unit 2 of my Treehouse Techdegree assignments.
It takes the list items from the index.html and only lets 10 students display at a time, while creating links
to navigate throughout the rest of the students. The program also creates a search function.

This project was built using a combination of standard JavaScript and JQuery.

How it works:
The program divides the total number of student items into sections of 10. Another function creates links to
modify the function to engage a different section of 10. The search function, gives the pagination function
a new class to use and paginate.
